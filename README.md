# Matemáticas del aprendizaje de máquinas
Mathematics of machine learning course, UNAL Spring 2023


This repository includes all the work I completed for the "Mathematics of Machine Learning" course at the National University of Colombia. This course is part of the graduate programs in Applied Mathematics and Finance and Actuarial Sciences.


[*Ocuppancy detection*](https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Matematicas-del-aprendizaje-de-maquinas/blob/main/Bank_note_authentication.ipynb): Contains five different machine learning models such as random forest and logistic regression to perform the task of predicting whether a room is occupied or empty.


[*Bank note authentication*](https://github.com/jdcarrascali/Matematicas-del-aprendizaje-de-maquinas/blob/main/Bank_note_authentication.ipynb): This repository contains  the same five different machine learning models to perform the task of determining whether a dollar bill is fake or genuine.
